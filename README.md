Diabetes Prediction System
A machine learning-based system to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using medical data. This project focuses on data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Features
Data loading and preprocessing from CSV datasets

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization

Training multiple machine learning models

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

Saving and loading trained models

User-friendly prediction interface for new patient data
